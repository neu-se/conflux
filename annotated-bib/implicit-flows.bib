        Kang \etal propose propagating taints only along select control flows in order to address under-tainting in ``information-preserving'' transformations, which are defined as being transformations that have the properties of an injective function.
        To identify branches related to ``information-preserving'' transformations, they first perform dynamic analysis to collect execution traces.
        Then, they analyze the execution traces to find control-flow paths that can only be reached by a single input value.
        Propagation rules are generated to mitigate under-tainting along the branches of these control-flow paths.
        Lastly, the dynamic analysis is rerun with the generated rules.
        The authors evaluated an implementation of their approach by tracking the flow of sensitive information in word processing applications and found that it successfully addressed under-tainting in that context.
        \par
        Kang \etal demonstrate an approach for mitigating a specific form of under-tainting caused by not propagating taints along control flows.
        However, they do not suggest or evaluate general-purpose control flow semantics.
